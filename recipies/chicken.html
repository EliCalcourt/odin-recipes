</h1>

<p>
<ul>
<li>2 chicken breasts</li>
<li>Old Bay seasoning</li>
<li>Butter</li>
<li>Chicken Stock cube</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h2>Instructions</h2>

<p>
<ol>
<li>Prepare the Chicken: Pat the chicken breasts dry with paper towels to remove excess moisture. This helps the seasoning adhere better and ensures a nice sear.</li>
<li>Season the Chicken: In a small bowl, mix the Old Bay seasoning, garlic powder, onion powder, paprika, salt, and pepper. Rub the seasoning mix evenly over both sides of the chicken breasts.</li>
<li>Cook the Chicken: Sear the chicken breasts for about 5-7 minutes on each side, or until they are golden brown and cooked through. The internal temperature should reach 165°F (74°C).</li>
<li>Serve: Serve the chicken breasts with lemon wedges on the side and sprinkle with chopped parsley if desired. Enjoy with your favorite sides!</li>
